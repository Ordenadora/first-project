  <p> How to taste your perfect chocolate?</p>
    
<p>Important: Begin the tasting with the chocolate with the lowest percentage of cocoa. Start with white chocolate, then milk chocolate and finally dark chocolate. Gradually work up to high-percentage varieties. Chocolate is best tasted in a calm atmosphere so that you are able to concentrate on your senses. In the following we will explain the main principals. </p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Sight:</b>
The first impression is also important when it comes to chocolate tasting. Therefore, you should first pay attention to the chocolate’s appearance – colour, an even structure and sheen</li>
    <li><b>Touch:</b>
      Now you can assess the structure of the surface (from smooth to rough or grainy).</li>
    <li><b>Hearing:</b>
Hold a piece of chocolate to your ear and break it. Pay attention to the noise it makes: it may be distinct or rather dull. High-quality unfilled chocolate breaks with a distinctly perceivable cracking sound. The edge of the break is smooth and without crumbs.</li>
    <li><b>Smell:</b>
You can use your nose to perceive the chocolate’s many aromas: You can either inhale its scent by holding a piece directly under your nose or you can let the chocolate melt in your mouth, breathe out and then inhale the aromas.</li>
    <li><b>Taste:</b>
We now come to the most intense experience of chocolate tasting: Let a piece slowly melt in your mouth. Spread the chocolate with your tongue to bring it in contact with your taste nerves. What do you perceive?</li>
  </ol>
